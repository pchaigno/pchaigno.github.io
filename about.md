## Credits

This blog is generated from [Markdown files](https://github.com/pchaigno/pchaigno.github.io) by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). It uses [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript) to display interactive plots. The JavaScript code for footnote popups was taken from [Jason A. Heppler's blog](https://jasonheppler.org/2012/06/06/popup-footnotes), with some fixes applied.


## Privacy

I rely on Google Analytics to gather statistics for this blog.
If you have DNT enabled or if you use the appropriate ad-blockers and privacy-related add-ons, Google Analytics will be blocked.

Nevertheless, this blog also relies on several CDNs to load JavaScript libraries (plotly's and Google's for plotly.js and jquery.js), which depending on your settings and add-ons, may also track your session.


## Myself

I'm a software engineer at [Isovalent](https://isovalent.com), where I work on [Cilium](https://cilium.io)'s datapath.
Before that, I was a research engineer at [Orange Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_S.A.#Orange_Labs), where I completed a PhD thesis on software networking in multi-tenant platforms (which led me to work with BPF a lot).
On my spare time, I co-maintain [github-linguist](https://github.com/linguist), the library used to identify the languages of files on GitHub and GitLab.

Despite some articles describing work done while at Orange Labs and Isovalent, the articles on this site are my own and by no means represent the opinions of my past and present employers.

You can contact me by email at `paul.chaignon@gmail.com` or as `pchaigno` on Freenode and OFTC.
