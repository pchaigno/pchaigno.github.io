## Credits

This blog is generated from [Markdown files](https://github.com/pchaigno/pchaigno.github.io) by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). It uses [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript) to display interactive plots. The JavaScript code for footnote popups was taken from [Jason A. Heppler's blog](https://jasonheppler.org/2012/06/06/popup-footnotes), with some fixes applied.
